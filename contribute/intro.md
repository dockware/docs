# Intro

Shopware is Open Source!  
And that means you can actively **support the community** and improve the platform for everyone around the world.

Still, sometimes it's a bit hard to set up everything and prepare your Pull Request on GitHub.

That's why dockware **\#contribute** exists.

It should help you to get the latest version of Shopware up and running in a minimum amount of time.

Please keep in mind, we do our best to make it as fast as possible. Though we cannot make PSH commands faster, we can only try to speed up the whole workflow for you.
