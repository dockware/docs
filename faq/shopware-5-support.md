# Shopware 5 Support

**Do we support Shopware 5?**

The main focus of dockware is definitely Shopware 6.  
Still we heard your requests about supporting Shopware 5.  
  
So we have decided to do a limited support of Shopware 5 with a few versions \(and not every single one\).  
  
It works basically the same as with Shopware 6. Only a few things like watchers and so on are either different or not included.  
  
Please see [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/dockware) for existing Shopware 5 versions.
